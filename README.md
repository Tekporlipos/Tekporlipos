## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Platane/snk/raw/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg" />
</p>

I believe great software should be:

- 🧱 **Well-architected** — clean data models & APIs  
- ⚡ **Performant** — optimized queries & efficient systems  
- 🔒 **Reliable & secure** — production-ready by default  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** — built with strong teamwork  
- 📈 **Scalable** — designed to grow with users  

I take strong ownership of the systems I work on and care deeply about clean architecture, maintainability, and performance.

## 💼 What I Do

### 🗄️ Full-Stack Engineer & Data Engineer
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/database.png"/>
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/api.png"/>
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/server.png"/>
</p>

I design and build backend systems that serve as the backbone of modern applications.

- Design RESTful and GraphQL APIs supporting complex workflows  
- Structure, normalize, and optimize relational and NoSQL databases  
- Implement secure authentication, authorization, and data access layers  
- Ensure reliable data storage, retrieval, and integrity  
- Optimize queries and backend performance for scale and speed  

**Technologies I frequently use:**  
Laravel, NestJS, Spring Boot, Node.js  
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB  
Redis, message queues, background jobs  

---

### 🎨 UI/UX Engineering & Product Design Systems
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/figma.png"/>
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/design.png"/>
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/web-design.png"/>
</p>

I design and engineer **user-centered interfaces** that balance **aesthetics, usability, performance, and scalability**.

My work spans **UX research → wireframes → high-fidelity design → production-grade UI systems**.

- Translate **Figma designs into scalable React & Next.js component systems**
- Design **mobile-first, responsive layouts** optimized for real-world usage
- Build **accessible (WCAG) UI components** and interaction patterns
- Engineer **design systems** using Tailwind, ShadCN, Radix UI, and Storybook
- Craft **complex workflows and forms** with intuitive UX and minimal friction
- Optimize UI performance for **low bandwidth and mobile networks**

I approach UI engineering as **product design + system architecture**, not just styling.

---

### ⚛️ Full-Stack Development & Frontend Integration
<p align="center">

</p>

I work across the full stack to ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend systems.

- Build **Next.js and React applications** with clean component architecture  
- Integrate frontend interfaces with backend APIs and databases  
- Implement **server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, and optimized data fetching**  
- Architect **frontend state management and data flow** using TanStack Query & Zustand  
- Collaborate closely with designers and backend engineers to align **data contracts and UX needs**  
- Debug and resolve cross-layer issues efficiently  

My goal is always to ensure that **data flows smoothly from the database to the user interface with zero friction**.

---

#### 🔹 Next.js Expertise

I use Next.js extensively to build **modern, scalable, production-grade web platforms**.

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)  
- API routes and backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns  
- Optimized routing, layouts, and streaming UI  
- Authentication flows and protected routes  
- Integration with backend services and distributed systems  

Next.js allows me to deliver **fast, SEO-friendly, and highly interactive user experiences** backed by **robust backend architectures**.

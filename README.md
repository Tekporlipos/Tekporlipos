Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m John Dzikunu, a Full-Stack Engineer with 4+ years of professional experience designing, building, and maintaining scalable, data-driven web applications and backend systems used by real users across multiple regions, including the U.S., UK, and Africa.

My core strength lies in backend architecture, database management, and full-stack system integration, with hands-on experience using Next.js, React, Laravel, NestJS, Spring Boot, and modern cloud-native tooling. I’m particularly passionate about building interactive platforms, assessment-based tools, and AI-enabled features that empower users to grow personally and professionally.

I specialize in:
- **Backend architecture & data management**
- **Next.js & React-based frontend systems**
- **API-driven full-stack applications**
- **AI / LLM-powered features**
- **Remote collaboration with U.S. & European teams**

I enjoy building **interactive platforms**, **assessment-based tools**, and **intelligent systems** that help users grow personally and professionally.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Platane/snk/raw/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg" />
</p>

I believe great software should be:

- 🧱 **Well-architected** — clean data models & APIs  
- ⚡ **Performant** — optimized queries & efficient systems  
- 🔒 **Reliable & secure** — production-ready by default  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** — built with strong teamwork  
- 📈 **Scalable** — designed to grow with users  

I take strong ownership of the systems I work on and care deeply about clean architecture, maintainability, and performance.

  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/api.png"/>
  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/server.png"/>
</p>

I design and build backend systems that serve as the backbone of modern applications.
	•	Design RESTful and GraphQL APIs supporting complex workflows
	•	Structure, normalize, and optimize relational and NoSQL databases
	•	Implement secure authentication, authorization, and data access layers
	•	Ensure reliable data storage, retrieval, and integrity
	•	Optimize queries and backend performance for scale and speed

Technologies I frequently use:
	•	Laravel, NestJS, Spring Boot, Node.js
	•	PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
	•	Redis, message queues, background jobs

</p>


I work across the full stack to ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend systems.
	•	Build Next.js and React applications with clean component architecture
	•	Integrate frontend interfaces with backend APIs and databases
	•	Implement server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, and optimized data fetching
	•	Collaborate closely with frontend engineers to align data contracts and UX needs
	•	Debug and resolve cross-layer issues efficiently

My goal is always to ensure that data flows smoothly from the database to the user interface without friction.

⸻
🔹 Next.js Expertise

I use Next.js extensively to build modern, scalable web applications.
	•	Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
	•	API routes and backend-for-frontend patterns
	•	Optimized routing, layouts, and performance
	•	Authentication flows and protected routes
	•	Integration with backend services and databases

Next.js allows me to deliver fast, SEO-friendly, and highly interactive user experiences backed by solid backend systems.

  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/robot.png"/>
</p>


I have hands-on experience building and integrating AI and LLM-based features into production systems.

Examples of AI-powered capabilities I’ve worked on include:
	•	Short-answer and text analysis
	•	Tone and sentiment detection
	•	Intelligent content generation
	•	Automated classification and prioritization
	•	Decision-support tools for operational teams

My focus is always on:
	•	Making AI features useful, explainable, and reliable
	•	Integrating them cleanly into existing backend architectures
	•	Ensuring AI outputs align with real user and business needs
